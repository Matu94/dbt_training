# dbt Bootcamp Learning Project:

This repository contains all of my project files, models, and work from the **Complete dbt Bootcamp on Udemy**. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate the concepts of analytics engineering using dbt (the data build tool).

## About the Course:

This project is based on the curriculum from a comprehensive, hands-on course that takes you from the absolute basics of dbt to advanced concepts. It's an excellent resource for anyone looking to build a solid foundation in data transformation and modern data warehousing principles.
